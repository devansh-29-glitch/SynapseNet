# 🧠 SynapseNet: Simulated Neural Signal Classifier

SynapseNet is a neuroscience-inspired deep learning project that simulates and classifies synthetic brain signals using convolutional neural networks.

The project generates synthetic EEG-like data and trains a lightweight neural model to distinguish between two simulated mental states :- “focused” and “calm”.  
It demonstrates how neural time-series data can be processed, visualized, and learned by AI systems, laying the groundwork for future brain-computer interface (BCI) research.

## 🔍 Overview  
**SynapseNet** is a proof-of-concept project that simulates brain-like electrical signals and trains a neural network to classify cognitive states (such as *calm* vs. *focused*) based on those signals.  

While the data here is synthetic, the pipeline mirrors real EEG workflows, from signal generation and preprocessing to neural classification, making this a compact demonstration of how artificial intelligence can model neural activity.

This project was built as part of my neuroscience + AI research portfolio, showing the power of computational models to decode patterns from complex biological data.
