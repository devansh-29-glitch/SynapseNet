# 🧠 SynapseNet: Simulated Neural Signal Classifier

SynapseNet is a neuroscience-inspired deep learning project that simulates and classifies synthetic brain signals using convolutional neural networks.

The project generates synthetic EEG-like data and trains a lightweight neural model to distinguish between two simulated mental states — “focused” and “calm”.  
It demonstrates how neural time-series data can be processed, visualized, and learned by AI systems, laying the groundwork for future brain-computer interface (BCI) research.
